  <p>Wassup IU family</p>

<p>I am Ky the guy that is oh so Fly! I am a proud member of the class of 2022. A 2018 groups scholar as well as a 21st century scholar. I am running to be your Student Body President!</p>

<p>I started off like most students trying to find a home at this very large campus! Joining the Black Student Union helped me not only find my place but my voice at IU. I now serve as the President of the Black Student Union and I have held this position for the last 2 years! As the President of BSU I have worn many hats, that have allowed me to address and solve complex problems at this University.</p>

<p>As an outsider to the IU student government, I witnessed first hand how separate this entity had became. Most students didnâ€™t feel as if they could lean on the student government because their voices went unheard, ignored, and even dismissed. Students were hurting due to the impact of not only the COVID-19 Pandemic, but also the display of present and historical traumas marginalized communities face. IUSG had the opportunity to show up and it fell short of the commitment to listening to the student voice.</p>

<p>Recent events have led to the creation of the Rainbow Coalition of Indiana University where I serve as a member. The primary mission is to hold all systems that aim to serve students accountable. We understand that this university has many blemishes, and students are calling for a change. We as students are no longer asking for reform we are demanding it!</p>

<p>We are running to commit to making IU a home for all students, that supports diversity, student activism, students holistic health, environmental justice, and academic reform. Moreover I am beyond confident that Madeline and I have the ideas, experience, and the drive that we have used throughout our time at IU to Reimagine a new normal where student voices are elevated in every endeavor.</p>

  <p>Hey Hoosiers!</p>

<p>My name is Madeline Dederichs and I am running to be your next IU Student Body Vice President! I believe that our student government has the strength and potential to unify all students across campus for holsitic and collective action. As an intern, director, congressional representative in IUSG, and president of my own organization, I have committed my energy to solving difficult problems and finding creative solutions that keep student needs as a priority and holding the administration accountable.</p>

<p>Outside of my work as a student, I especially enjoy fostering a dog from the Bloomington Animal Shelter this semester, challenging my power rock climbing at Hoosier Heights and drinking 'Cozy Cabin' coffees outside of Soma!</p>

<p>Moving forward, we must stand with our peers facing adversities and leave our campus in a better place for the next generation of Hoosiers. Our student leaders can no longer serve as passive extensions of IU administrators, IUSG has fallen short of these values. The work Ky and I have done for years is a standard we promise to commit to and continue in 2021.</p>

<p>Voting starts April 1st</p>
